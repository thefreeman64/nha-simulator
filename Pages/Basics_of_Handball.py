Handball is based off of the already existing kid's game of four-square, with a couple modifications. Two teams of four go against each other on opposite sides of a chest-high net in the middle of a 15 by 7m rectangle.

A match starts with the lineman (positions explained in the "Positions" section) serving from the back line and a match will not end until one opponent bounces the ball into the opponents' rectangle and then having it touch the ground anywhere outside of aforementioned rectangle.

This results in 1 point, and a team must reach 21 points to win, with tie-breakers at 20 pushing the win condition to 22, tie-breakers at 21 pushing the win condition to 23, and so on.

st.markdown("### **Positions**")
st.write("""
There are four positions on each side.

**Forwards**: Right up against the net are the two forwards. Their role is to score points, so they are typically tall to cover the space above the net and able to smash the ball down or maneuver around defenders. One is the main forward and the other is a secondary forward with more play-making and defensive duties.

**Center**: On the backline, the center is the playmaker who runs the offense with assists and sometimes helps rebound (stopping the ball from exiting the court).

**Lineman**: The primary defender and rebounder, often bigger and athletic, also serving the ball for most teams. This role is often interchangeable with the center.

All roles are fluid, and players may shift based on skill sets.
