The National Handball Association is a fake sports league based off of the semi-fake sport of handball. This project was created by me about two years ago inspired by a love for sports and my then-new interest in the NBA, which this fake league is very much based off of. 

In this, you can explore the basics of handball, the history of the NHA, the different teams and how they are doing today, and a betting simulator which will allow you to bet on teams to win the championship, randomized every time you simulate it.
