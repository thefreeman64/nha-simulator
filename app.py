The National Handball Association is a fake sports league based off of the semi-fake sport of handball. This project was created by me about two years ago inspired by love for sports and my then-new interest in the NBA, which this fake league is very much based off of. The goal of this installation was to present an in-depth exploration of the NHA plus a fake betting league you can interact with, however this was not possible so I only have here provided the fake betting league.
